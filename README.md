### About

Password hashing is a small exercice I've been doing to train with Python and html, and explore the world of hashed and salted passwords and security.
It consists on a extremely simple html page which invites the user to type a password in a input. The main goal of this exercice was to retreive the password with Python, salt and hash it and display the hashed password on the html page, then compare the initial password to its hashed version.

In a Python environnement I imported Flask as a template engine for the html requests, render and debugging. I also worked with the bcrypt module to encrypt the password.
